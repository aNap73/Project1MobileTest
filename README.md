This was one of my favorite projects at RBoot. I wrote the three.js pieces that glue the youtube, giffy, and materialize front end together. Truly awesome fun working in three.js.  I think this project was the one that I really learned to sling some callbacks.

When you tripple click a cube I send a ray through the screen and process the first object that collide with that vector.  I read data out of the cube, and decide whether to send the data out to be read for articles and text, or played in the case of youtubes.

Fun Stuff.

Enjoy!
