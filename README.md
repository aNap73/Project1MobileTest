This was one of my favorite projects at RBoot. I wrote the three.js pieces that glue the youtube, giffy, and materialize front end together. Truly awesome fun working in three.js.  I think this project was the one that I really learned to sling some callbacks.

When you tripple click a cube I send a ray through the screen and process the first object that collides with that vector.  I read the data out of the cube, and decide whether to send the data out to be read for articles and text, or played in the case of youtubes. I remember doing the math for some of the ray calculations in matrix algebra when I was a kid. This was far easier.

Fun Stuff.

Enjoy!

## Update!

Migrated the giffy call to my heroku server route from raw exposed api key as we were instructed originally. Still need to figure out a solution for gapi etc... working on it!
